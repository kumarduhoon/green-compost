With a plug-and-play logic, activated by a single button, you can throw all food wastes, with or without bones, into our machines without discrimination. The automation system, which detects the density of the waste thrown in, starts the fermentation process according to the type of waste. Silently and without the need for a user, it completes the separation process with 95% efficiency at the end of the determined time, by heating, dehydrating, making antibacterial with UV-C, and separating with microbial bacteria within 6 to 12 hours. It performs odorless separation thanks to the Hepa filter. The resulting waste is 100% organic and rich-content compost fertilizer. Compared to equivalent machines, its low energy consumption and being 70% smaller, as well as not requiring any water inlet or discharge line unlike other machines and operating with 220 V electricity, reduce construction and operating costs during and after installation. The system does not require continuous maintenance or operator participation like other machines. It is easily portable and offers your business trouble-free benefits within the scope of zero waste without having to deal with issues such as part breaking, at a low operating cost."})})]})})})}export{n as default};
